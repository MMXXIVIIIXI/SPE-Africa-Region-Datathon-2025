The Society of Petroleum Engineer (SPE) Data Science and Engineering Analytics Technical 
Section (DSEATS) Africa Datathon Challenge presents an exciting opportunity for participants 
to harness the power of machine learning to address real-world challenges in the oil and gas 
industry. Organized by SPE DSEATS Africa Region, this challenge aims to leverage historical 
production data to accurately classify a group of 20 wells based on their observed 
performance trends. 

1.2 Challenge Objective 
Participants are expected to work in teams of 3 to 5 persons (max) from at least 2 different 
organizations and/or schools to develop a machine learning (ML) model that accurately 
categorizes the 20 wells provided in the dataset by analysing their daily production data 
trends. The teams should explore innovative approaches to accurately categorize or classify 
the wells.
